# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Hotel Pipeline 2024

## Unlocking the Future of Hospitality with Data-Driven Insights

Welcome to my EDA on Hotel Pipeline 2024, an exploratory data analysis project that aims to dive deep into the STR Global Data - Hotel Pipeline 2024 dataset. This project uncovers trends, patterns, and opportunities in the hospitality industry, with a special focus on African markets. Built with Python, this analysis showcases my data science skills in cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting hotel pipeline data to inform strategic decisions. 

## Project Overview
This project explores the STR Global Data - Hotel Pipeline 2024 dataset to reveal insights about upcoming hotel developments, particularly in African countries. From verifying city-level data (e.g., Lagos, Cairo) to analyzing amenities like meeting spaces and room counts, this EDA provides a comprehensive look at the hospitality landscape. Whether youâ€™re a hotel industry professional, a data enthusiast, or a recruiter, this project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.
